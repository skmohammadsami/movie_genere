# movie_genere
A film genre is a stylistic or thematic category for motion pictures based on similarities either in the narrative elements, aesthetic approach, or the emotional response to the film.
Loading Data:

Importing the dataset containing movie information and plot summaries.
Data Visualization:

Visualizing the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of movie genres and other relevant features.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies.
Text Cleaning:

Cleaning the textual data (plot summaries) by removing stopwords, punctuation, and other noise.
Some Data Statistics:

Calculating and presenting basic statistics about the dataset, such as the number of movies per genre.
Get Top Bigrams:

Identifying and extracting the most common bigrams (pairs of adjacent words) from the plot summaries.
Label Encoding of the Target Variable:

Converting the categorical target variable (movie genres) into numerical labels for model training.
Train Test Split:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.
Feature Extraction:

Utilizing advanced techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to extract relevant features from the plot summaries.
Training and evaluating various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine to classify movies into different genres.
This structured approach ensures that the entire process, from data loading to model evaluation, is systematically organized and easy to follow.
